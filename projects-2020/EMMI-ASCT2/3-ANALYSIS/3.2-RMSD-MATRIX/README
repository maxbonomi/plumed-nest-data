The clustering is done in two steps:
1) calculation of the RMSD matrix in parallel over multiple CPUs/cores (this directory)
2) processing of the RMSD matrix and actual clustering with gromos algorithm (serial, in 3.3-GROMOS/)

To calculate the RMSD matrix, you need to:

- install the MDAnalysis python library - see instructions here: https://www.mdanalysis.org

- run it on a cluster as an array job (with 128 tasks in this example) after updating the slurm file included here (example.slurm).
  Please adapt to your queue system if different from slurm!
